This project is a small tool that I have developed for others. I regularly use the shutdown command on my PC for a range
of reasons, going to sleep, downloads etc. So I have taken it upon myself to make a small simple tool for others who
may wish to do the same thing.

TODO:
- [X] Some simple error handling 
- [X] More input handling, not allowing 0 input for both mins and hours
- [X] Config gui to state - e.g shutdown scheduled or not
